# WhatsApplebee's

WhatsApplebee's is a real-time chat application that only works if you are currently inside an Applebee's restaurant.

The code included here is the full application as it exists on the [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whatsapplebees/id867011102). The only thing missing is the app icon, which has been left out as it contains the official Applebee's logo.

If you're looking for the source code to the site http://whatsapplebees.com, check out the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/lazerwalker/whatsapplebees/tree/gh-pages).


## Setup

    $ pod key set "parseAppID" "YOUR-APPID-HERE"
